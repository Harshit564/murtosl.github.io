<h2>Career Thoughts</h2>
  <p><ul>
    <li>Take one of your cross-department courses in management; even if it's not knowledge management. You might not want to be in charge of people's careers, but you will end up in charge of various other things.</li>
    <li>You have made the comment several times 'I am not a designer'. That is now invalid; it is certainly not your strong point so it is something you need to focus on improving.</li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <h2>Thesis Ideas</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>It would be interesteding to do a case study of wiki vs other website vs random files vs whatever as the core format of internal documentation. That being said, a technology is not always best in every team or every type of use. The focus may want to be turned more towards WHEN a certain format is better than IF a certain format is better. Otherwise the end result will be 'there is no winner.'</li>
    </ul></p>
    
  <h2>Snarky Thoughts</h2>
  <p><ul>
    <li>I realize most people probably major in English and then get stuck in technical writing, thus being dissapointed. But I really have problems viewing this as a 'creative' career; I view it more as educational or closer to management depending on the task. You do what's needed to inform and keep informed. Perhaps if you view it from a purely writing perspective, I can see hoping for more flexibilty, but at the end of the day the job is very user-focused, not focused on your personal ideas.</li>
