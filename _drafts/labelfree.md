Label-Free
I prefer women.
Does that make me a lesbian? 
Maybe.
I used to call myself one.
Until I realized I liked a guy.
But that took until I was 24.
And I’ve always like girls.
So I’m bi?
Sure.
Except I’ve never stared longingly at a guy from across the room wishing he’d talk to me.
Never really thought a guy was cute.
But there’s been a few girls…
And I’d date a trans-person.
So I’m pan?
Sure. 
But no one knows what that means.
And I don’t care to explain it.
So…
I prefer women.

When I realized I had a crush on a guy, I also realized it took me so long to notice because I was too tied to my label. 
You feel how you feel, and you shouldn’t brush off feelings just because it doesn’t fit a label you gave yourself.
Maybe you’re straight, but are realizing you like your best friend a little too much.
Well, that’s how you feel.
Maybe you’re bi, but you lean so heavily towards one gender you don’t feel like the label fits you.
That’s how you feel.
Maybe you’re asexual, but find yourself thinking more physically about the person you’re dating.
That’s how you feel.
Feelings are complicated enough; there is no need add in the complexity of an identity crisis.
The power of labels is that it makes it easier to find a community of people who feels like you. And that is important; a community provides a sense of support, and can make you feel less alone and strange. But even within a labeled community, people apply that label to themselves differently. No one feels exactly the same as anyone else.
Some people find comfort in having a label; it gives them a better sense of identity. And that’s fine, but don’t let your label confuse or restrict you. Don’t fight your feelings just because it isn’t how you picture yourself.
People change, people grow, and people love. It’s OK to feel whatever you’re feeling, even if they’re feelings you’d never thought you’d deal with. You are far too complex of a person to be defined by a word. So let yourself change, let yourself grow, and let yourself love.
