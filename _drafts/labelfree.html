<h1>Label-Free</h1>

<p>I prefer women.<br/>
Does that make me a lesbian?<br/> 
Maybe.<br/>
I used to call myself one.<br/>
Until I realized I liked a guy.<br/>
But that took until I was 24.<br/>
And I've always like girls.<br/>
So I'm bi?<br/>
Sure.<br/>
Except I've only felt feelings for a guy after getting to know them decently well.  I've never really thought a guy was cute.<br/>
But there's been a few girls...<br/>
And I'd date a trans*.<br/>
So I'm pan?<br/>
Sure? <br/>
But no one knows what that means.<br/>
And I don't care to explain it.<br/>
So...<br/>
I prefer women.</p>

<p>When I realized I had a crush on a guy, I also realized it took me so long to notice because I was too tied to my label. </p>
<p>You feel how you feel, and you shouldn't brush off feelings just because it doesn't fit a label you gave yourself.</p>
<p>Maybe you're straight, but are realizing you like your best friend a little too much.
<p>Well, that's how you feel.</p>
<p>Maybe you're bi, but you lean so heavily towards one gender you don't feel like the label fits you.
<p>That's how you feel.</p>
<p>Maybe you're asexual, but find yourself thinking more physically about the person you're dating.
<p>That's how you feel.</p>
<p>Feelings are complicated enough; there is no need add in the complexity of an identity crisis. You are not a word.</p>
<p>The power of labels is that it makes it easier to find a community of people who feels like you. And that is important; a community provides a sense of support, and can make you feel less alone and strange. But even within a labeled community, people apply that label to themselves differently. No one feels exactly the same as anyone else.</p>
<p>Some people find comfort in having a label; it gives them a better sense of identity. And that's fine, but don't let your label confuse or restrict you. Don't fight your feelings just because it isn't how you picture yourself.</p>
<p>People change, people grow, and people love. It's OK to feel whatever you're feeling, even if they're feelings you'd never thought you'd deal with. You are far too complex of a person to be defined by a word. So let yourself change, let yourself grow, and let yourself love.</p>
