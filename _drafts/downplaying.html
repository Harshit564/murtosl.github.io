<h1>I'm Fine: How to Hit Rock Bottom</h1>

<p>I’m fine.</p>

<p>I’m always fine.</p>

<p>I’m not allowed to not be fine.</p>

<p>I have a problem with downplaying.</p>

<h2>An Intervention</h2>



<h2>A Bit of a Headspin</h2>

<p>In early May, I went to donate blood for the first time. My friend donated blood every so often and encouraged me to go with her. So we went.</p>

<p>I was felt decent after they were done, so I got up and walked over to the drinks.</p>

<p>Then I started to get really lightheaded, so I sat down at a nearby table.</p>

<p>"Are you OK?"</p>

<p>"I’m fine; I just need to sit down for a bit."</p>

<p>Then I started to get really hot.</p>

<p>"Are you OK?"</p>

<p>"I’m fine."</p>

<p>I thought I'd feel fine in a minute; I didn’t want to bother anyone. This did not fool my friend, who is a nurse.</p>

<p>Everything started to sound funny, and my friend went to get staff members.</p>

<p>I woke up on the floor facing the ceiling, having completely fainted.</p>

<p>I was very not fine there; if my friend wasn’t watching out for me, I could have easily injured myself. Covering up how I was physically feeling did not help anything.</p>

<p>Covering up about how I was feeling was not helping anything.</p>
