				<p>Why hello there!</p>
<p>This blog is spilt into three parts: This part, that part and the other part.</p>
<p>This part doesn't have a name. I'm going to write whatever I feel like here.</p>
<p>That part is named <a href="/controversatory.html">The Controversatory</a>. That's where I'm also going to write about whatever I feel like, except it's going to be about loaded topics. Separting that section gives you the opportunity to avoid those things. Sometimes I will take those topics seriously, and sometimes not.</p>
<p>The other part is <a href="/worthfull.html">The Worthfull Blog</a>, which is about discovering your worth as a person, and is far more serious.</p>
<p>So, you know. Hi.
