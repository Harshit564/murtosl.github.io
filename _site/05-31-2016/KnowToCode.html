<p>There are three choices to fill the summer of an American full-time grad school student:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 80px;">
<li>Work</li>
<li>More classes</li>
<li>Travel</li>
</ul>

<p>I've always wanted to go backpacking through Europe, and I think it's something a lot of people dream of.</p>
<p>But Europe is really, really expensive. And so is grad school. So that wasn't an option</p>
<p>So where else can you go?</p>

<p>Certain countries offer Working Holiday visas. A working holiday visa let's its holder work in the country for up to a year. But it also expects that you'll spend the majority of your time travelling. <a href="http://www.gooverseas.com/blog/americans-guide-working-holiday-visas" target=_blank >You can read more about them here.</a></p>

<p>Australia and New Zealand offer these visas to Americans. Due to the favorable exchange rate, I chose to go to New Zealand.</p>

<p>But I stopped in Sydney, Australia first. And that's where I'm writing this from.</p>

<p>It was actually cheaper to fly to Sydney than to New Zealand by about 100 dollars, and I thought I should probably stop and see a bit of Australia while I'm down here. After all, the flight from San Francisco to Sydney took 15 hours, and that was only one leg of the journey.</p>
