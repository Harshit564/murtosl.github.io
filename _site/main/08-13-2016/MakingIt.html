			<h1>How to Know You've Made It</h1>
				<p>Today, I felt like I made it.</p>

<p>Years ago, likely over 10 years ago, I started browsing photo blogs. I was especially interested in urban exploration and city streets. Worn, used, tagged, damaged, forgotten or unnoticed aspects of a city facinated me.</p>

<p>I was especially facinated by the photographers who would find these places and capture that neglected, taken-for-granted feeling in a photo. By looking at other's photos, I learned the foundations of framing and position of pictures. I learned what feels powerful.</p>

<p>My first, and still beloved, photo blog was Satans Laundromat. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110310011842/http://www.satanslaundromat.com/sl/" target=_blank>This site isn't even online anymore, but is preserved in the wayback machine.</a> Subway cars, kitchy street signs, broken glass, and handwritten notes. The things no one looks at.</p>

<p>In a few years, when I'd start actually taking photos, I'd discover I usually find cities a bit boring, and I'd rather photograph landscapes.</p>

<p>But, that blog lead me onto another, long forgotten blog. The photographer liked to take bright, oversaturated images of New York City. They did this in order to 'capture New York with the sense of wonder that people feel when they think about the city.'</p>

<p>That is my photographic phillosopsy. Wonder, whimsy and a bit of magic.</p>

<p>I tend to oversaturate my images. I love bright colors. I love deep shadows. And maybe that's not exactly how it looked in reality, but it's certainly more fun to look at.</p>

<p>In reality, most sunsets aren't jaw dropping. But, with a good enough framing of an interesting landscape, you adjust your RAW file enough and something mystifying can pop out of it.</p>

<p>Like so:</p>

<p><img width=500 src="/images/nasOri.jpg" alt="plain colored image"><br/>
<img width=500 src="/images/nasRAWd.jpg" alt="very colored image">
</p>

<p>But when I figured that out, I still didn't feel like I was a good photographer. At the time, I didn't even know how to something like that. A photo was a photo: you point your camera and take a  picture. What can you do to add that extra sparkle?</p>

<p>So I went to the library and rented a book-binge of beginners photography books. I then purchased an advanced Point-And-Shoot camera, knowing I was far too lazy to carry around a large DSLR camera.</p>

<p>And then I, slowly, learned how to use my camera in the way that worked best for me.</p>

<p>And today I felt like I finally got it, four years later.</p>

<p>I've started making some photos in black and white, although sometimes it's because I just can't get the colors bright enough.</p>

<p>I've just begun taking 360 degree photos, although I usually have a part of my shadow interupting the picture.</p>

<p>I've learned I work best with my camera in shutter speed mode, although I'm guilty of overexposing a lot of things.</p>

<p>My framing is usually exactly what I want, although sometimes I have to do addtionally cropping later.</p>

<p>But I look at the photography I was so envious of 10 years ago vs my photography today, and I'm there. I'm actually past there. And I've developed my own style, methods and tastes along the way.</p>

<p>And I'm sure I'll look back at this post in another 10 years and laugh at how much of an amatuer I was back then, but I feel I've surpassed my initial inspiration to get into photography. And I feel successful, which is something I really never feel. I feel like I actually accomplished something.</p>

<p>So I declare today the day I've made it. I'm not perfect. I'm not selling prints; I don't run a photo blog. There are still things I don't understand about my camera. But I'm happy. And that's a great feeling.</p>
