<p>I have an interest in visual novels. Someday I might even write one.</p>

<p>There's a system you can use to make a visual novel called Twine.</p>

<p>But this isn't a post about Twine. <a target=_blank herf="http://www.auntiepixelante.com/twine/">It's a post inspired by this post about Twine.</a></p>

<p>I was reading this tutorial, where the second benefit of Twine is listed as</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold; color: #FAAC02; text-align: center;">You don't need to know how to program!</p>

<p>It then goes on to teach how to write things like:</p>

<p class="code">[[beckon to you|Tree]]</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class="code">if visited_oak eq "yes"</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p class="code">set stones_of_power = stones_of_power + 1</p>

<p>Which looks a lot like code....</p>

<p>Now, the tutorial doesn't go into 'Hey, this is an if statement!' or 'This is an increment!' Terms that a more computer science-y tutorial would find important.<p>

<p>This author just wanted to write interactive stories, and teach other people how to write interactive stories.</p>

<p>But 'You don't need to know how to program?'</p>

<p>I think any programmer would agree that variables and if statements make this type of writing code. The author has written a coded procedure, in this case a procedure through a story. That story is therefore a program.</p>

<p>This raises a question.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Why is not having to code a selling point?</p>

<p>In this case, a blanantly wrong selling point.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I think computer science as a field scares people. It all seem so difficult.</p>

<p>Programmers are geniuses and IT staff are all-knowing technical gurus.</p>

<p>You know what the key to knowing how to program or fix a computer is?</p>

<p>Google. And persistent dedication in trying to get something to work.</p>

<p>It is a skill, just like cooking or riding a bike. You start out rough and get better with practice.</p>

<p>It doesn't take being a genius. It shouldn't be seen as something to run away from.</p>

<p>There is, however, the type of person that believes in the Real Coder. And the Real Coder does not write Visual Novels.</p>

<p>The Real Coder stays up all night writing advanced algorithms. Coding is not only their job; it is their hobby.</p>

<p>The Real Coder only uses Ruby. No, sorry, the Real Coder only uses C++.  No, sorry, the Real Coder only uses assembly language. The Real Coder knows why that's best. Why don't you?</p>

<p>The Real Coder is offended that you'd consider <i>THAT</i> coding. It's only a handful of statements. The language isn't even Turing complete. It's just too simple.</p>

<p>The Real Coder is belittling those who might start having an interest in programming.</p>

<p>The Real Coder needs to realize that people start somewhere, and that starts are simple.</p>

<p>The Real Coder needs to learn that people can stick with the simple stuff. Not everyone needs to deep dive into everything. Not everyone cares to, and that's fine. Sometimes, people just want to write a story, or make a webpage. And those types of projects take effort that should be recongized.</p>

<p>The additude that doesn't recongize smaller programming projects as programming keeps people from further persuing the field. And I think that's incredibly harmful in this day and age.</p>

<p>If you've written a story using Twine, you've programmed. Don't try to tell yourself you haven't just because it didn't seem as hard as you were expecting, or that it isn't too complex.</p>
