			<h1>Australasia VS US Culture</h1>
				<p>I am currently backpacking through New Zealand. I've also visited Australia while I'm down here.</p>

<p>The Australian/New Zealand/ American cultures are similar enough, but there are still differences. These are the notes about my trip with things I have noticed.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing post, unless I've learned everything about New Zealand in 28 hours.</p>

<ul>
<li>Calories are measured in kilojoules. You can eat 8700 of those! (Don't eat 8700 calories.)</li>
<li>No one in Australia said "G'day" to me :(</li>
<li>You know what they do say all the time? "No Worries."</li>
<li>Australian parks have no problem sending you down a somewhat difficult hiking trail with no warning.</li>
<li>Takeaway instead of to go. Although I did see a sign that said '2 go.'</li>
<li>The credit card machines handle non-pin-and-chip cards better than in England, but my card still sometimes requires a signature. I've seen people enter their pin as well. I don't really know what kind of system they have. I'm lucky American switched to at least having chips recently (like, six months ago) or I wouldn't know what to do.</li>
<li>A store who's name is only a number is a brothel. They aren't allowed to have formal names. This is true in both Australia and New Zealand.</li>
<li>Convience stores sell soda and candy. Pharmacies sell beauty products and drugs. Never the two shall mix.</li>
<li>Lots of Chinese writing on everything. It then occured to me that's because we're pretty close to China.</li>
<li>All modern art museums look the same on the inside. White interiors, multiple stairs in unique places, and black, bold writing on the walls. This isn't a difference; I just think it's funny.</li>
<li>"Freephone" for a toll-free number.</li>
<li>Pedestrian crossing are marked with a blue circle and white arrow, when not at a stoplight. The crosswalk itself is not marked.</li>
<li>When at a stop light, Australia and New Zealand have a consistent tapping-like tone that plays when the light switches. In America, sometimes, the light will speak to you ("Wait...Wait...Walk Sign is On"), but not usually, and only in big cities.</li>
<li>Hot Spa or Spa Tub instead of hot tub.</li>
<li>For the love of all things sacred, do not order a milkshake. A milkshake is lukewarm, frothy flavored milk. The best thing I can compare it to is if you left ice cream melt but gave it the consistency of a head of a beer. You want a thickshake.</li>
<li>Cider is far more popular in New Zealand than in America. Which is great for me because I hate beer.</li>
<li>Licensed establishments can sell alcohol.</li>
<li>Some establishments also let you BYO (bring your own) alcohol. I have yet to try this, though.</li>
<li>No problem selling liquor in the grocery store, but they also have dedicated 'bottle stores.' Selling liquor at a grocery store is illegal for beverages over a certain alcohol percentage in Minnesota. My local grocery store opened up a separate liquor store in the same building to get around that law. The laws are looser in Wisconsin, but I think it still needs to be separated.</li>
<li>On that note, they can probably sell alcohol on a Sunday.</li>
<li>I saw a McDonalds selling Macaroons in Sydney.</li>
<li>"Brekky" for breakfast</li>
<li>I don't know what Sky TV is exactly, but it's everywhere in actual hotels.</li>
<li>USA has Craigslist. New Zealand has TradeMe. Australia has GumTree.</li>
<li>And more to come...</li>
</ul>
