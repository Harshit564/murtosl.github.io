<p>The Australian/New Zealand/ American cultures are similar enough, but there are still differences.  These are my notes about my trip with things I have noticed.</p>

<p>I ended my first post with 'there will likely be a part two'. This is that part two!</p>

<ul>
<li>Chicken eggs in OZ are brown. Chicken eggs in the US are white. We have access to brown eggs in the US, but they cost more for no good reason. I didn't realize how weird this was, until my roommmate couldn't comprehend a white egg that didn't come from a duck.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it is very easy and only pennies more expensive to buy cage-free eggs in OZ. In the US, cage free eggs are a speciality item and may cost dollars more than cagged-eggs.</li>
<li>Feijoa! I can't buy it in Minnesota. I also don't know how to pronounce it.</li>
<li>A portable heater you use in an individual room is not a 'space heater,' it's just a heater.</li>
<li>I was watching the news when it randomly switched to spoken Maori with English subtitles halfway through for an segment. This would only happen in America if there was footage of someone speaking a foriegn language, not for a whole segment.</li>
<li>A lot of the TV is UK based. It's hard to find UK shows in America.</li>
<li>On the other hand, Bravo appears to be a generic channel in NZ, rather than a paid cable channel like it is in America.</li>
<li>Swearing is uncensored on TV the vast majority of the time. We were watching a special on the KKK: a certain word you may be able to imagine they used frequently was completely broadcast. This was probably one of the more jarring cultural differences.</li>
<li>On that note, people think the KKK has more pull in the US than they actually do. We should probably try to change that perception. Speaking of ignorance and racism, in America, your grandma makes racist comments about African-Americans. In New Zealand, she makes them about Maori people. In both countries, Grandma is being a terrible person.</li>
<li>Quiche and Pies are everywhere in OZ. You'll struggle to find quiche in America, and you'll fail to find meat pies. In Minnesota, especially northern Minnesota, you may find Pasty, but it's not the same as it's Scandinavian in origin, and has vegitables in the pie.</li>
<li>Sausage rolls are not a thing in America. You might find Pigs in a Blanket, or other forms of wrapped little smokeies, but it's not quite the same, and they usually are homemade.</li>
<li>Red cream soda. We have cream soda in America: it looks very similar to beer (and tastes nothing the same as the red soda). I have seen the red cream soda called 'ice-creme soda.' I have also seen dark-brown cream soda, and I have no idea what the difference is.</li>
<li>Drinks that market themselves as being full of protein or vitamins do not have a label on them listing the percentage of vitamins. In the US, there is a specific food label to list the amount of the vitamins in grams.</li>
<li>Speaking of food labels, there is no daily percentage value in OZ. In America, each food label will say what percentage a serving of that product contains, based on a 2000 calorie diet. So, a chocolate bar may be labeled as containing 35% of the amount of sugar you should eat in a day, and 20% of your daily fat intake.</li>
<li>"Health Cover" would be improper grammar in American English. It would be health coverage, although we'd usually say health insurance. You'd never go out and buy coverage; you'd go buy insurance. Your insurance then provides you with coverage, assuming it covers whatever you need it to.</li>
<li></li>
